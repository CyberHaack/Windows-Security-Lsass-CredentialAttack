# Windows Security Lab - Lsass Credential Attack Simulation 

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for **educational purposes only**. It is designed to demonstrate how attackers can exploit the **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe)** to retrieve **NTLM hashes** and other credentials. The techniques and tools discussed in this project should **never be used to illegally access computers, networks, or systems without explicit authorization**.


## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how attackers can exploit the **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (lsass.exe)** in Windows to retrieve **NTLM hashes**. Using tools like **Mimikatz**, this project simulates the process of extracting hashes from memory, highlighting the risks associated with unprotected lsass.exe processes and the importance of securing sensitive credentials.

## Steps Taken
This section outlines the steps taken to retrieve **NTLM hashes** from the **lsass.exe** process using **Mimikatz**. Screenshots are included to provide visual guidance for each step.


### Step 1: Set Up the Lab Environment
1. Install **VirtualBox** and set up a Windows 10 virtual machine.

2. Temporarily disable **Windows Defender** to allow **Mimikatz** to run without being blocked:
   - Click on the Start Button > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Click on Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings > Toggle the button to turn off Real-Time Protection.

### Step 2: Download and Prepare Mimikatz
1. Download **Mimikatz** from its GitHub repository (See the link in the Tools Section above).

2. Extract the files to a folder on the Windows VM.
<img width="862" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a175558-3b4b-4248-a62c-4979635ea34b" />

### Step 4: Let's Simulate a Normal Login using the login credentials you created when setting up the Windows 10 VM

### Step 5: Navigate to the folder where you extracted Process Explorer and run "procexp64.exe"
<img width="956" alt="13 - Process explorer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa81fd43-4185-4707-a84e-2a11fbd4fb0c" />


### Step 6: Locate lsass.exe in the list of processes, Use the search option ( Ctrl F) to filter the processes. Verify the PID and confirm that it is running from the default location "C:\Windows\System32\Lsass.exe 

<img width="583" alt="14 - Process Explorer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac051764-16f4-4ab6-84bc-4114b9cdf3ce" />

### Step 7: Let's Run Mimikatz to Extract NTLM Hashes
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator > Navigate to the **Mimikatz** folder and run `mimikatz.exe`:
   
- cd C:\Users\Kachi\Downloads\Mimikatz\x64 (Edit to fit your file Locatio Path)
- mimikatz.exe

Your output should be similar to the output in the screenshot below:

<img width="408" alt="7a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8835b702-a2cd-4862-bc69-f0d1c948a8f0" />


### Step 8: Let's Confirm that we have the right privilege by running the prompt below:
- privilege::debug
If this is successful, you should see the Privilege "20" Ok

### Step 9: Let's Use the following command to extract NTLM hash:
- sekurlsa::logonpasswords
<img width="411" alt="8a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9804ae6-054f-4272-ab31-74c1282775c1" />

### After running these Cmdlets, you should have something similar to this screenshot below:

1. **Extracted Credentials:**
   - The output from **Mimikatz** shows the credentials of logged-in users, including **NTLM hashes**, **SHA1 hashes**, and other authentication data.
   - Example from the screenshot:
     ```
     * Username : Kachi
     * Domain : DESKTOP-HPNSILK
     * NTLM : a9262a62e297016f32e9937dbe346087
     * SHA1 : b5da5c1793954a9211555d36b7d2f6d0af88d957
     ```


2. **Key Observations:**
   - **NTLM Hash:** The NTLM hash (`a9262a62e297016f32e9937dbe346087`) is a cryptographic representation of the user’s password. Attackers can use this hash to impersonate the user without knowing the actual password.
   - **SHA1 Hash:** The SHA1 hash (`b5da5c1793954a9211555d36b7d2f6d0af88d957`) is another cryptographic representation of the password, often used for additional authentication mechanisms.
   - **No Plaintext Password:** In this case, the plaintext password was not retrieved, but the hashes are still valuable to attackers.

### How Attackers Use This Technique
1. **Credential Theft:**
   - Attackers use tools like **Mimikatz** to extract credentials from the **lsass.exe** process. This allows them to steal **NTLM hashes**, **Kerberos tickets**, and even **plaintext passwords** in some cases.
   - With the extracted hashes, attackers can perform **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)** attacks, where they use the hash to authenticate as the user without needing the actual password.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - If the extracted credentials belong to an administrator or a user with elevated privileges, attackers can escalate their access to sensitive systems and data.
   - For example, if the user **Kachi** is an administrator, the attacker can use the stolen hash to gain administrative access to the system.

3. **Lateral Movement:**
   - Attackers can use the stolen credentials to move laterally across a network, accessing other systems and resources.
   - This is particularly dangerous in corporate environments, where attackers can compromise multiple systems using a single set of stolen credentials.

### Real-World Implications
1. **Risks of Unprotected lsass.exe:**
   - The **lsass.exe** process is a prime target for attackers because it stores sensitive authentication data in memory.
   - If **lsass.exe** is not properly protected, attackers can easily extract credentials and compromise the system.

2. **Mitigation Strategies and Best Practices:**
   
   - **Re-enable Windows Security and turn on Real-Time Protection**
   - **Enable LSASS Protection:** Open the Run Dialog and type in secpol.msc > Navigate to Local Policies > Security Options > Enable Local Security Authority (LSA Protection)
   - **Enable Credential Guard:** Open PowerShell as an Adminsitrator and run the Script:
     Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Windows-Defender-CredentialGuard", then Restart your VM or Host Computer
   - **Disable the NTLM protocol**
     **Note**: Before disabling this protocol, confirm that your environment does not rely on it for authentication as this could break the functionality for legacy applications or systems.
     - **Monitor lsass.exe:** Use tools like Sysmon or Process Explorer to monitor lsass.exe for unusual activities

### Conclusion
This project has been able to show the technique commonly used in real-world attacks to steal credentials, escalate privileges, and move laterally across networks. By understanding how this attack works, we can take steps to protect **lsass.exe** and prevent credential theft.


If you want a challenge your skills, I encourage you to attempt to crack the hashed password using either of the optional tools I highlighted in the Tools Section above. Let me know if you were successflly able to achieve.

#### If you got this far, I sincerely applaud you and your taste for knowledge 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.
